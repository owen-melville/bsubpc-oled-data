<h1> Data and Code for: Studying the Influence of Axial Substituent on Hyperfluorescence in Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Using Boron Subphthalocyanines as Fluorescent Emitters </h1>

All Programs and Data collected by Owen Alfred Melville, PhD as a part of his postdoctoral fellowship with Professor Timothy Bender at the University of Toronto.

<h2>Folder Breakdown:</h2>

- <b> Raw OLED Data: </b> Raw data collected from the OLEDs during characterization. This includes optoelectronic data as a function of Voltage. 

- <b> IC6 Evaporation Logs: </b> Raw data collected during the deposition of the OLEDs from the IC6 which controls the deposition of the thin films.
  
- <b> Offline Spreadsheets: </b> Summary deposition and electro-optical data for each device, labelling for each device index (eg OLED-001 corresponds to what materials).
  
- <b> Python: </b> Python programs and corresponding batch files used to analyze the raw data.
  
- <b> Output Data: </b> Contains analytical outputs for each deposition run and device. This includes a large number of graphs and visualizations.
