<h1>Output Data Readme</h1>

This folder contains all the results of the automated analysis in the <b>Python</b>folder. There are two sorts of folders: Deposition folders and OLED folders. Deposition folders contain the results of analysis of the deposition runs (from the IC6) and end in the suffix <b>-L#</b> where # ranges between 1 and 6 representing the different layers in a single OLED. OLED folders do not contain this suffix. 

<h2>Deposition Folders</h2>

<b>Deposition Graphs:</b>

These graphs show the input power, deposition rate, and total thickness as a function of time. The shutter was open only between two zeroes in the thickness data, which can be seen below as between 500s and 700s, approximately. This is how the thickness of the layer is calculated.

<b> Composition Graphs: </b>

These graphs show the distribution of composition (by rate) within different thickness bins in each emissive layer. You will only see these in devices with a Host and one or more Dopant (typically <b>-L3</b>)
