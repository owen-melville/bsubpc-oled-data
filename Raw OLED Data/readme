Raw Data Explanation

The names of the folders (eg OLED-001) correspond to devices. The organization and explanation of each label is contained within the Offline Spreadsheets folder. 

Within each folder there are three types of files:

1. Summary optoelectronic files labelled by pixel. These often look like <b>A1-1</b> where <b>A1</b> is the pixel (between A1 and D5), and the <b>-1</b> refers to the measurement attempt number (eg first, second, third). Missing pixels were not tested, sometimes because of an issue accessing the pixel physically (A5 is often missing).

2. Spectra as a function of voltage labelled by pixel. These are labelled the same as the last files but with the extension <b>_counts</b>. The rows and columns are unlabelled. The columns are the same voltages as those from the summary files (with a couple filler columns of 0s) and the rows are wavelengths (from 380 to 780 nm in all cases)

3. The <b>_SPD</b> files were not used for any analysis
