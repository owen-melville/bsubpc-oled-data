1. Don't use "None" in the Deposition Subtype Column, just repeat the Deposition Type
Why? The program interprets None not as the string None but as the absence of an object
Old rows are OK as long as they aren't being updated

2. Don't have the Excel spreadsheets open while you run the programs

3. Usually its best to fill in all the columns of any 'input' sheet before running (just put asd if you don't know what to put)
